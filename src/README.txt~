	The source code files (.c) as well as the include files (.h) are present in warmup2 directory.
	1) To build the executable 'warmup2'  :  Type "make" or "make warmup2".
	2) To clean the object and temp files :  Type "make clean"

| GRADING |
+---------+

Basic running of the code :  out of 100 pts

Missing required section(s) in README file 	: NO
Cannot compile 					: NO
Compiler warnings 				: NO compiler warnings
"make clean" 					: working perfectly
Segmentation faults 				: NO
Separate compilation 				: YES. All source files are getting seperately compiled
Using busy-wait 				: NO. You can check by using top command
Handling of commandline arguments:
    1) -n 	: working perfectly
    2) -lambda 	: working perfectly
    3) -mu 	: working perfectly
    4) -r 	: working perfectly
    5) -B 	: working perfectly
    6) -P 	: working perfectly
Trace output :
    1) regular packets: working perfectly
    2) dropped packets: working perfectly
    3) removed packets: working perfectly
    4) token arrival (dropped or not dropped): working perfectly
Statistics output :
    1) inter-arrival time 			: working perfectly
    2) service time 				: working perfectly
    3) number of customers in Q1 		: working perfectly
    4) number of customers in Q2		: working perfectly
    5) number of customers at a server 		: working perfectly
    6) time in system 				: working perfectly
    7) standard deviation for time in system 	: working perfectly
    8) drop probability 			: working perfectly

Output bad format 							 : working perfectly
Output wrong precision for statistics (should be 6-8 significant digits) : statictics are being printed correctly as specified
Large service time test						: working perfectly
Large inter-arrival time test 					: working perfectly
Tiny inter-arrival time test 					: working perfectly
Tiny service time test 						: working perfectly
Large total number of customers test 				: working perfectly
Large total number of customers with high arrival rate test 	: working perfectly
Dropped tokens test 						: working perfectly
Cannot handle <Cntrl+C> at all (ignored or no statistics) 	: Handles < cntrl+c > perfectly
Can handle <Cntrl+C> but statistics way off 			: Handles < cntrl+c > perfectly and statistics are also printed
Not using condition variables and do some kind of busy-wait 	: Only Condition variables used
Synchronization check 						: No semaphores used. Only mutex used
Deadlocks 							: No deadlocks
